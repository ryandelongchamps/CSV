Part 1 (Sitka 1)
   - The first part of this project introduced csv implementation using "import csv" and showed the basics of importing data from these types of files
Part 2 (Sitka 2)
   - The second part of the project added date data to the graphs.
   - This allowed for a better way to present the data to the viewers so that the information could be more easily understood.
Part 3 (Sitka 3)
   - In the third part, more data points were introduced and were plotted on the same graph. The figure now has the ability to show high and low 
     temperatures from the dataset

   - The fourth part introduced the Death Valley dataset and introduced more funcitonality from pyplot.
Part 5 (csvhw)
   - The final part compared both the Sitka data and the Death Valley data by creating 2 subplot graphs in one visualization
   - Automatic indexes were also introduced to rid of any hard-coded data or titles
